# Life Beyond Apocalypse - Elixir - V3


**Work in progress**

A zombie like game made with Elixir.
It uses the item game database from [Cataclysm DDA](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA).
Although it may look like it, the game will tend to be different since I started
with the idea of multiplayer which Cataclysm DDA doesn't support.

It's rewritten from 0 with new ideas and in no way similar to the other LBA versions.

I want to achieve the following:

* You can play locally in the commandline
* Multiplayer, connect to a server via the commandline  with either telnet, openssl or nc
* Web Based Interface with Phoenix
