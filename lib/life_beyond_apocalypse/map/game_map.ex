Overmap is the world map, what you see when you hit the m key, it is essentially
endless and can be limited only by external means.
Character can see five tiles on the overmap in any direction,
binoculars double that distance, but some structures still obstruct range of view.

Each overmap tile (e.g. house, crossroad, forest) equates to a single tinymap,
or 24x24 player-size tiles. Tinymap is not really used in the code much,
but it is available because it is more efficient than a map.

Map is 156x156 player-size tiles and used in normal gameplay;
the game has a map m, which is the area which is considered "in-play,"
inside which monsters, fields, traps, etc. will be processed.
Other than their respective sizes, map and tinymap are completely identical.

Both tinymap and map are formed of an array of submaps.
A submap is 12x12 player-sized tiles,
and also keeps track of any fields, items, traps,
and computers in that area.
Tinymap is made up of 2x2 submaps; map is made up of 13x13 submaps.

submap 12x12 player tiles
Tinymap 24x24 player-tiles  (2x2 submap)-> track fields, items, traps, computers
Tinymaps -> used inside
Map 156x156 player-size tiles (6.5 tiny maps) or 7 tiny maps 168x168
A map shows various "locations"
Overmap or world map=> Multiple maps

Enum.each(0..255, fn (c) ->
  IO.puts IO.ANSI.color(c) <> "COLOR #{c} HELLO THERE"
