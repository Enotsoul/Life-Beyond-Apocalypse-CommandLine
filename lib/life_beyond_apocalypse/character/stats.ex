  For all stats, minimal values are 4 and increasing values above 14
   will cost 2 points instead of 1! 14 is considered to be very high,
   the max human value. Players can go higher,
    but those values should be considered exceptionally high.

    # Moves / Actions / Speed / Energy
    Default value: 1000 | Min value: 0 | Max value: 1000
    Each action in the game requires a certain amount of energy and increases fatigue

    Energy is replenished whenever we consume certain items (food, water)
    and when we sleep.
    You may not be fatigued but have no energy if your hunger is great.

    A certain action may fatigue you by 3 points.
    But the same action may require 5 energy points.

    Certain actions add to your fatigue but do not use any energy.
    Examining items, people etc ads to fatigue but doesn't use any energy.
    Moving ads fatigue but doesn't use energy

    For each action we increase the actions and total_actions variables.
    When we get to 10 actions regardless of the type of action 1 energy is decreased.

    Energy is replenished for every 10 actions
    Food < 100  Water < 100   Fatigue < 100   Energy +
